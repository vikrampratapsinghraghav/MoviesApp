The story commences in Giza, Egypt, circa 1928, where an archaeological expedition unearths an ancient ring with cryptic hieroglyphs. The film then moves to the present day, where Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is busily trying to convince a group of skeptics that the pyramids were not built by man, but by an extraterrestrial force. After the lecture, a military man approaches him and offers him a job translating the said ring; its inscriptions actually constitute a map to a massive stargate (or interstellar portal). The army sends over resident crackpot colonel Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell) to travel through the stargate and see what's on the other side; Jackson accompanies him, and the two men turn up in a desert planet on the other side of the universe, with three moons in its sky. The world in question is ruled by Ra (Jaye Davidson), a hermaphroditic Egyptian sun god, who oppresses hordes of slave workers. Jackson and O'Neill then join forces to help the said workers revolt against their oppressor.~ Paul Brenner, All Movie Guide","distributor_id":75,"distributor":"eOne","release_dates":[{"release_date":"2001-09-26","notes":"XXX"}],"age_rating":[{"rating":"PG ","age_rating_image":"https://assets.movieglu.com/age_rating_logos/xx/pg.png","age_advisory":"Contains mild language and fantasy violence"}],"duration_mins":116,"review_stars":0,"review_txt":"","trailers":null,"genres":[{"genre_id":10,"genre_name":"SciFi/Fantasy"},{"genre_id":5,"genre_name":"Action/Adventure"},{"genre_id":10,"genre_name":"SciFi/Fantasy"}],"cast":[{"cast_id":1357,"cast_name":"Kurt Russell"},{"cast_id":7523,"cast_name":"James Spader"},{"cast_id":8690,"cast_name":"Alexis Cruz"},{"cast_id":8691,"cast_name":"Viveca Lindfors"},{"cast_id":8692,"cast_name":"Mili Avital"},{"cast_id":8693,"cast_name":"John Diehl"},{"cast_id":8694,"cast_name":"Leon Rippy"},{"cast_id":8695,"cast_name":"Carlos Lauchu"},{"cast_id":3451,"cast_name":"Djimon Hounsou"},{"cast_id":868,"cast_name":"Erick Avari"}],"directors":[{"director_id":636,"director_name":"Roland Emmerich"}],"producers":[],"writers":[{"writer_id":1114,"writer_name":"Dean Devlin"},{"writer_id":2496,"writer_name":"Roland Emmerich"}],"show_dates":[{"date":"2023-04-04"},{"date":"2023-04-05"},{"date":"2023-04-06"},{"date":"2023-04-07"},{"date":"2023-04-08"},{"date":"2023-04-09"},{"date":"2023-04-10"}],"alternate_versions":[],"status":{"count":1,"state":"OK","method":"filmDetails","message":null,"request_method":"GET","version":"TEST_79_XXv200","territory":"XX","device_datetime_sent":"2023-04-04T20:41:22.511Z","device_datetime_used":"2023-04-04 20:41:22"}},

To get over the border, they kidnap Jacob Fuller, a widowed preacher played by Harvey Keitel, and his two children, Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu). Once south of the border, the quintet park their RV at a rough-and-tumble trucker bar called The Titty Twister, where Seth and Richie are supposed to meet a local thug. After a couple of drinks, they realize that they're not in a typical bar, as the entire place begins to teem with vicious, blood-sucking vampires. With the odds stacked greatly against them, the Fullers and Geckos team together in hopes of defeating the creatures of the night.

In a field hospital in Italy, Hana (Juliette Binoche), a nurse from Canada, is caring for a pilot who was horribly burned in a plane wreck; he has no identification and cannot remember his name, so he's known simply as the English Patient, thanks to his accent. When the hospital is forced to evacuate, Hana determines en route that the patient shouldn't be moved far due to his fragile condition, so the two are left in a monastery to be picked up later. In time, Hana begins to piece together the patient's story from the shards of his memories; he's actually Count Laszlo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), of Hungarian nobility and an explorer working with a group mapping uncharted territory in North Africa. An Englishman, Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth), soon joins Almasy's team; travelling with him is his lovely and spirited wife, Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Katherine and Laszlo soon fall in love, which leads Laszlo to betray his friend, his country and all that is dear to him. Meanwhile, Hana and the Patient are joined by Kip (Naveen Andrews), a Sikh with a gift for defusing mines, and Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), an intelligence agent who knows some of Laszlo's most shameful secrets.
